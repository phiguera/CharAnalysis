## _CharAnalysis_: Diagnostic and analytical tools for sediment-charcoal analysis

_CharAnalysis_ is a program for analyzing sediment-charcoal records, when the goal is peak detection to reconstruct "local" fire history. Diagnostic tools help determine if peak detection is warranted, and if so, what parameters are most reasonable. Analytical tools help summarize results statistically and graphically. The entire code is distributed and well commented. Users are encouraged to "look under the hood", understand what's going on, and modify the program to suit individual needs.

##Acknowledgments

Many features in _CharAnalysis_ are based on the programs CHAPS, by Patrick Bartlein (U of OR), and Charster, by Daniel Gavin (U of OR). The Gaussian mixture model used in _CharAnalysis_ was created by Charles Bouman (Purdue). _CharAnalysis_ was written in and compiled by Matlab 7.0 with resources from the University of Washington, Montana State University, the University of Illinois, and the University of Idaho. Development of the program has benefited greatly from discussions with and testing by members of the Whitlock Paleoecology Lab at Montana State University, Dan Gavin, and Ryan Kelly.
